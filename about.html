         <u>About</u><br><br>
         Digital Hell: Open World is an information resource sharing project inspired
         by 2000's early-web optimism and generosity. It is co-presented in collaboration with Also Cool Mag. <br><br>

         Digital Hell was started in 2018 by Remote Access out of San Francisco as a DJ mix series to
         sonically express frustration and despair about tech-capitalist dystopia.
         It has since moved to Montr√©al where it has continued as a radio show on N10.as
         as an ongoing project, and now continues through the Open World series.<br><br>

         Open World is a tutorial and resource sharing series to facilitate teaching,
         learning and sharing within the DJ, music and visuals community while within a pandemic.
         Before the quarantine, Open World was an IRL Open-Decks DJ night organized with DJ Pacifier,
         Knapsack, and MVCOKO. The same spirit of sharing now continues online. Its goal is to create an
         online space to share knowledge with each other, to give and receive while digitally separated,
         and to build information resources that will continue to be accessible once quarantine lifts.
